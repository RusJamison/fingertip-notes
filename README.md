Fingertip Notes is the site which helps and encourages the public to store their to do list, notes, grocery lists. It is tailor made to allow the public to store other data they might require in the future.

Momentarily forgetting why you walked into a room or struggling to find the right word are common experiences for many people—and they’re usually nothing to worry about.

As we age though, we may wonder whether these memory lapses signal a more significant health issue. When should you be concerned about memory loss?

This site will not address the medical side of memory loss but gives the public the tool they can use not to forget some important events or tasks up coming in their lives.

Technology is on our side, while there are lot of To Do applications on the market they don't address the issue of update and due date.

- We are the most fortunate and informed habitants to live on planet earth who can interact with technology.

- Integrated Circuits (IC) technology has improved greatly over the past ten years, making data storage easier, smarter, reliable and easy to retrive.

To minimize unnecessary forgetting important tasks and information this site assist the public to record their notes and retrive them anywhere they are. Engineers, Medical staff and Scientists will have special option to populate their notes/to do lists.
